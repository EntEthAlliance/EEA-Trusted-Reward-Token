# Trusted-Token
:tada:Welcome to the EEA Trusted Token central repo!:tada:

## Background

EEA is launching a _trusted execution environment (TEE) testnet_ on top of a Blockchain network (Kaleido running the Pantheon client using tokenization features). 
The first use case is an EEA trusted reward token to incentivize EEA membership to participate more in EEA activities!
