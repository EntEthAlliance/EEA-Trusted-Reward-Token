# Trusted-Token
:tada:Welcome to the EEA Trusted Token central repo!:tada:

## Background

EEA is launching a _trusted execution environment (TEE) testnet_ on top of a Blockchain network (Kaleido running the Pantheon client using tokenization features). 
The first use case is an EEA trusted reward token to incentivize EEA membership to participate more in EEA activities!

## Token Description

The EEA Reward token is used to incentivize participation of EEA member organizations and their employees in EEA SIGs and TWGs. Tokens are issued for participation in EEA activities such as working group calls, deliverables or F2F meetings. The more committment is required by a member organization to perform an activity the higher the reward. If a member organization commits to something and then does not deliver on the the committment, tokens are taken away from the organization's balance. Negative balances are possible. Tokens can be shared between members and can be redeemed for financial credits against their membership, lowering an organization's annual membershp fee5tr. At the same time, a negative balance will lead to an increase in either the renewal or the current annual membership fee. The normal token accounting period is the anniversary cycle of a membership organization (1 year -- not one calendar year). 

In addition, redeemed points are not lost. Just as with airline miles, used tokens accumulate over the lifetime of an organization and represent the level of committment of an organization to the EEA; it becomes a measure of an organizations EEA reputation. This also extends to the employees of the organization who earn the tokens in the first place; they will also keep those tokens as reputation tokens for the organization. 

These lifetime membership tokens are **not** transferable for neither the membership nor its employees that have earned them. For example, if an organization collects 10,000 tokens during its annual membership cycle, they can redeem the tokens for say a $10,000 credit to its membership. Or continue to accumulate. In addition, if the organizations lifetime membership total was 100,000 at the beginning of the membership cycle it would be 110,000 at the end of the cycle in this example. In addition, 10,000 points would be split across the organizations people who earned them.

### Redemption

1 EEA Token can be redeemed at the end of a membership cycle (1 year) for fiat currency at an exchange rate of 1 EEA token to 0.x USD. Where x is a number that is currently TBD (Suggestion is x = 98). Negative balances have to be redeemed at the end of a membership cycle for either an additional payment for the membership cycle to the EEA or an appropriate increase to next year's membership price. Redemption can never be higher than the subsequent year's membership fee.

### Sharing

EEA Tokens that have not been redeemed can be transfered to any member organization

### Initial Reward Token Distribution

Initial token amount is 0. No tokens are initially distributed. Tokens are created or destroyed (burned) based on validated submission of (not) completed actions.

### Positive Creation of Reward Tokens

Any defined EAA activity that is deemed appropriate to earn tokens. Amount of tokens earned are currently initial suggestion and will be added later. 

Initial Suggested List: 

1. Organization participating in any SIG/TWG/Steering Committee (SC) meeting (whether 1 or more participate is not relevant): +10 Token 
2. Being a chair of a SIG/TWG/SC meeting: +5 Token 
3. Contributing a written deliverable to a SIG/TWG/SC meeting: +100 Token 
4. Main editor to a written deliverable to a SIG/TWG/SC meeting: +200 Token 
5. Contributing to an EEA project: +1000 Token (Regular Contributor per resource -- resources can be people or compute resources), +2000 Token (Project Manager or highly specialized resourece), +10000 Token (Financial or Resource Project Sponsor)

### Negative Creation of Reward Tokens

Committing to any of the above (Creation of Reward Tokens) activities such as registering to participate in a SIG/TWG/SC and then not contributing/participating to that activity. Tokens are not burned but rather negative balances are created for member organizations which have to be redeemed at the end of a membership cycle.

### Reputation Tokens

Reputation tokens are created based on the earned reward tokens. The reputation tokens for individuals and organizations are created and accounted for the following way:

* Reputation Tokens of an Organnization = Sum of all earned rewards tokens of the employees of an organization participating in EEA activities
* Reputation Token of an individual =  Sum of all earned rewards tokens of an individual participating in EEA activities


## Token Questions

|    Question   |    Process    |  Answer  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Who controls a token, when, how and where?  | Sharing  | **Who:** EEA Member; **When:** Any time;  **How:** Sharing request to other member org; **Where:** No specific location required |
| Who issues a token, when, how and where?  | Issuance  | **Who:** EEA SIG/TWG chair on behalf of the EEA;  **When:** Upon completion of activity by EEA Member; **How:** EEA members completes or does not complete committed to activity; **Where:** SIGs/TWGs/Projects |
| Who redeems a token, when, how and where? | Redemption | **Who:** EEA Member; **When:** At Membership Anniversary (within a certain time frame e.g. 1 month); **How:** Redemption request to EEA Secretary; **Where:** On extension/close-out of EEA membership |
| Who liquidates a token, when, how and where? | Redemption | See Answer for Redemption process |
| What, if any, are the restrictions on token control, issuance, redemption, and liquidation? | All Proccesses | Token rules governing all processes and financial accounting are controlled by the EEA Steering Committee and follow the established Change Control process of the EEA. See the Token Model for control and restriction details |
| What are the Legal triggers to be considered? (money transfer regulation, securities trigger, gift card regulation, â€¦)? | All Proccesses | Token design is such that the EEA token is not a security (Is not used to raise money, is not promoted as an investment, will be issued on existing platform, is not freely exchangable, can only be used for one purpose, does not represent any interest in an entity) and cannot be traded except OTC through sharing and within the EEA ecosystem which is permissioned through the EEA membership rules. The EEA is using its established banking relationships to fullfill all applicable banking and money transfer law requirements. |
| Are there token usage fees? | Redemption | There is a fee through an exchange rate to cover the EEA administrative costs of the token |
| If there are token usage fees, what is the fee schedule by value exchange? | Redemption | Fee schedule is still TBD but will be fixed |
| Where and how is the economic value capture taking place and who are the participants? | Token Economics | **Where:** EEA SIGs and TWGs and Projects; **How:** Recording of EEA Member participation and contributions; **Who:** EEA Members, EEA Chairs, EEA Secretary|
| Where, how and through whom is economic value entering and leaving? | Token Economics | **Where:** EEA Secretary; **How:** Redemption Requests from Members: **Through Whom:** EEA Member and EEA Secretary |
| Are tokens treated as a GAAP liability or as a private currency? | N/A | GAAP Liability on EEA Balance Sheet |
| How are tokens financially accounted for? | N/A | Onchain in the token contract and offchain through a liability/credit on the EEA Balancesheet |
| Who is responsible for the financial accounting of tokens? | N/A | EEA Secreatary |
| What are the currency controls both qualitative and quantitative such as liquidity/supply requirements, exchange rates? | Relevant for a private currency only | Fixed exchange rate to account for EEA accounting costs. Redemption rules ensure that tokens can only be redeemed at the rate that membership dues are received. |
| Who or what sets those controls? | Relevant for a private currency only | EEA Steering Committee |
| Who or what implements them? | Relevant for a private currency only | Token SIG + Testnet TWG |
