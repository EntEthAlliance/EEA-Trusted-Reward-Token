      "businessDescription": "EEA Reputation Tokens are issued, upon vesting, to an organization's contributors establishing an individuals reputation. The token grant should be adjusted when commitments are met or before vesting indicating the split of reputation tokens by percentage to the contributors listed in the grant. The reputation split between contributors is finalized when the grant vests. Both Reward and Penalty tokens are matched 1-1 towards Reputation with the ability to improve or damage an individual's reputation. An individual's reputation cannot be negative so penalties will subtract 1-1 until exhausted or the account balance reaches 0. The reputation score of an organization is the sum of their contributors balances. These tokens are are lifetime tokens and are not transferable for any member that has earned them. EEA Reputation tokens are minted and burned, but are not redeemable.",
      "businessExample": "For example, if an organization collects 10,000 tokens during its annual membership cycle, they can redeem the EEA Rewards tokens for say $10,000 credit to its membership, or continue to accumulate. In addition, if the organization's lifetime membership EEA Reputation tokens total was 100,000 at the beginning of the membership cycle, it would be 110,000 at the end of the cycle in this example. In addition, 10,000 points would be split across the organization's employees who earned them.",
